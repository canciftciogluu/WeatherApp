# WeatherCano

WeatherCano is a simple weather application built with SwiftUI and CoreLocation. It retrieves the user's location and provides a basic structure for displaying weather data.

## 🚀 Features
- Retrieves **user's current location**.
- Uses CoreLocation to determine **latitude and longitude**.
- Simple and minimal **SwiftUI interface**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Swift**
- **SwiftUI**
- **CoreLocation**
- **Xcode**

## 📌 Purpose
This project was created for **self-improvement and experimentation with Swift development**. It does not include real-time weather data yet, but an API integration could be added in the future.

## 📍 Default Location
If the user's location cannot be retrieved, the app defaults to **Istanbul (41.0082, 28.9784)**.

## 🔧 Installation
1. **Open Xcode** and run the project.
2. If testing on a simulator, set a custom location via **Debug > Location > Custom Location**.
3. If testing on a real device, ensure **location permissions** are granted.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- API integration for real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).
- Enhanced UI/UX design.
- Location-based weather forecasting.
